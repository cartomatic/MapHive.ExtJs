# MapHive.ExtJs

A set of abstracted classes used by the MapHive web apps.
This code has an ExtJs package structure and should be used as a package.

Preferred way of setting it up is to clone the project and then bring it into another ExtJs project as a package.
In the package folder simply create a symbolic directory junction link named 'mh', that points to the location of the package source code, for example:
mklink /D /J mh C:\Whatever\ThePath\OfThePackage\Is

The code is based on ExtJs 6.x
